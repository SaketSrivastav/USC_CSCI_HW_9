Android App For My CSCI571 course

Mobile Application Exercise
-----------------------------------

This mobile application takes input of city name and the chain of hotel name. 
This application creates a dynamic results page having all the details of
the hotels in the city specified. Data is scraped from the tripadvisor.com using 
only regular-expressions. Using android native UI and HttpServlet we get the data 
and post to the facebook wall using Facebook Android SDK.
